# Introduction to Bots
Bots are small applications that run entirely within the Telegram app. Users interact with bots through flexible interfaces that can support any kind of task or service.

### How do Bots Work?
Telegram bots are special accounts that do not need a phone number to set up.
Bots are connected to their ownerâ€™s server, which processes inputs and requests from users.
Telegramâ€™s intermediary server handles all encryption and communication with the Telegram API.
Developers communicate with this server via an easy HTTPS-interface with a simplified version of the Telegram API â€“ known as the [Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).

<h4>How Are Bots Different from Users?</h4>
Bots are able to process inputs and requests in ways that user accounts canâ€™t, but there are several differences between a bot and a normal user.

<ul>
  <li>Bots donâ€™t have â€˜last seenâ€™ or online statuses â€“ instead they show a â€˜botâ€™ label in the chat.
  <li>Bots have limited cloud storage â€“ older messages may be removed by the server shortly after they have been processed.
  <li>Bots can't start conversations with users. A user must either add them to a group or send them a message first. People can search for your botâ€™s username or start a chat via its unique t.me/bot_username link.
  <li>By default, bots added to groups only see relevant messages in the chat (see <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#privacy-mode">Privacy Mode</a>).
  <li>Bots never eat, sleep or complain (unless expressly programmed otherwise).
</ul>
